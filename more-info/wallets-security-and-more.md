# Wallets, Security & More

## **What smart contracts am I interacting with while using DexGuru?**

DexGuru does not have a smart contract; instead, we use [meta-aggregation](https://docs.dex.guru/general/features/trading-tools/meta-aggregation). We use multiple decentralized exchange aggregators and their smart contracts. When you approve your token spending, you provide access to one of the following smart contracts:

## **What's the benefits of connecting my wallet to DexGuru?**

Connecting your wallet provides you complete access to the DexGuru platform, enabling you to:

* Add tokens to your own Favorites list

## **How can I change the wallet I'm using on DexGuru**

If you are using MetaMask on desktop, changing your wallet is as simple clicking on the MetaMask icon and changing your wallet there. This will be updated and reflected on DexGuru.

_**Note:** If you are changing your wallet that has not previously connected to DexGuru, then you will be asked to sign a transaction to confirm - for more details read the following section_[#whats-a-signature-request-and-why-do-i-need-to-sign-one-when-connecting-to-dexguru](wallets-security-and-more.md#whats-a-signature-request-and-why-do-i-need-to-sign-one-when-connecting-to-dexguru "mention")

## **Can I remove my wallet from DexGuru?**

Removing your wallet is as simple as clicking on the wallet icon and pressing on **"Disconnect Wallet"**.

## **Is DexGuru safe to connect my wallet to?**

Yes it is! DexGuru is a fully non custodial platform and your assets are always under your control.

Just like when you connect to any DApp on Web 3.0, the platform will only be able to view your wallet token balances and activity which are used show you your previous token trades.

## **What's a Signature Request? And why do I need to sign one when connecting to DexGuru?**

### **For First Time Users**

When connecting to DexGuru for the first time, you will be asked to sign a Signature Request which essentially uses your wallet to Login. Don't worry! This doesn't create any actual transactions, approvals or other interactions with your balances on your wallet, it's simply used to confirm you are the owner of the wallet on the device you are using.

Similar to how in Web 2.0, you are able to create an account or login websites using your socials (Facebook/Google/Twitter Accounts), in Web 3.0, by signing the cryptographic Signature request you are able to login onto apps by using your wallet. You'll most likely have logged in using the exact same way on other popular Web 3.0 apps such as OpenSea.

After you have signed it once, whenever you connect to DexGuru using the same wallet address and from the same device, you won't be prompted to sign again unless you have cleared your browser cache recently.

### **For Returning Users**

If you have already previously signed a Signature request, you may be prompted again to sign another one in the future.&#x20;

You may be asked to sign a Signature Request again with the same wallet address you have previously connected with, if you are:

* Connecting from a new Device
* Connecting from a new/different Browser
* Connecting from a browser you have previously connected with BUT have cleared the Cache/Local Storage
* Connecting from the same Browser but using a different browser profile

## **Why am I asked for Token Approval when trying to make a Swap on DexGuru?**

As with all DEXs/AMMs, the first time you swap a token you will need to complete a token approval to give permission for the smart contract to spend your tokens from your wallet.

Once you have approved the token once on DexGuru, you will be able to complete the swap and you won't need to do it again unless you are attempting to make a swap with a new Token that you have yet to approve.

In addition, since the Token Approval is an on-chain transactions, you will be required to pay a small gas fee (network transaction fee) for the approval.

## **Staying Safe on Web 3.0 & on DexGuru**

As with all new and emerging industries, the flow of new opportunities inevitably also attracts bad players into the space such as hackers and scammers.

Of course, this applies to Web 3.0 as well - and although we can't control the actions of bad players out there, we can always be proactive in being smart & safe when navigating web 3.0 to safeguard our wallets and funds.
