# Data Completeness

## **Data Completeness**

For the time being, for every DEX/AMM that is added onto DexGuru, we currently index and display transaction data **only from the date/time they are implemented**.&#x20;

This means for all transactions (and it's TX data) that have occurred before the date the DEX/AMM implementation date, **will not be included** in transaction lists, aggregates/counts and charts that involve the pre-implementation time period.

{% hint style="info" %}
ðŸ’¡ We are working on indexing and back-syncing all historical transactions and transaction data for every DEX/AMM that is supported on DexGuru. The current ETA for completion is by Q1 2022.
{% endhint %}

For the time being, a complete list of DEXs dates and their added date are available for your reference at [supported-dexs-amms.md](supported-dexs-amms.md "mention").
