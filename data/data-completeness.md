# Data Completeness

### DEXs/AMMs&#x20;

For the time being, for every DEX/AMM that is added onto DexGuru, we currently index and display transaction data **only from the date/time they are implemented**.&#x20;

This means for all transactions (and its TX data) that have occurred before the date of the DEX/AMM implementation date, **will not be included** in transaction lists, aggregates/counts and charts that involve the pre-implementation time period.

{% hint style="info" %}
ðŸ’¡ We are working on indexing and back-syncing all historical transactions and transaction data for every DEX/AMM that is supported on DexGuru. The current ETA for completion is by Q1 2022.
{% endhint %}

For the time being, a complete list of DEXs dates and their added date are available for your reference at [supported-dexs-amms.md](supported-dexs-amms.md "mention").

### Types of Transactions&#x20;

Currently, we only support the following types of transactions:&#x20;

1. **Swap** - an exchange of one token for another.
   * Buy&#x20;
   * Sell&#x20;
2. **Mint** - adding liquidity to a liquidity pool.&#x20;
3. **Burn** - removing liquidity from a liquidity pool.&#x20;
4. **Transfer** - trasfering tokens from one account to another.&#x20;
