# Off-Chain Data

## Usage of Off-Chain Data Sources

DexGuru strives to utilize On-Chain data as much as possible due to it's immutable, trustless and transparent properties.

However, we have included the usage of a very limited amount of data from well-established and trusted off-chain data sources. These are used as supplementary data, and only when and where necessary to help us provide additional information for a better and complete user experience.

Currently, our usage of off-chain data sources are: &#x20;

* [Trust Wallet's Asset Repo](https://github.com/trustwallet/assets) for Token Logos&#x20;
* [Coingecko's API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation) for basic Token information such as:&#x20;
  * Token Official Website/Social Media/Discord Channel
  * Market Cap
  * Circulating Supply
  * Fully Diluted Valuation
  * Max Supply&#x20;
  * Token Rank&#x20;
  * Token Logos Fallback
* [Token Lists](https://tokenlists.org) for Token Verification

Any changes regarding our usage of off-chain data sources, including both additions or removal will be updated here immediately.
