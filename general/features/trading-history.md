# Trading Volume and History

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2023-01-18 at 6.03.20 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You can see a real-time transaction flow in our Trading History area.&#x20;

A green arrow up indicates a transaction was a buy; a red arrow down means it was a sell.&#x20;

If we have enough data about the wallet that a trader used, we will add an icon to the transaction indicating the type of trader.&#x20;

🐢 - Casual Trader with $10k-$100k of a trading volume in the last 30 days

🦈 - Active Trader with $100k-$500k of a trading volume in the last 30 days

🐳 - Heavy Trader with $500k+ of a trading volume in the last 30 days
