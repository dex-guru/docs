# Market Activity

You can see a real-time transaction flow in our Trading History area.&#x20;

A green arrow up indicates a transaction was a buy; a red arrow down means it was a sell.&#x20;

If we have enough data about the wallet that a trader used, we will add an icon to the transaction indicating the type of trader.&#x20;
