Token price alerts are available for you after you connect your wallet.&#x20;

By default, notifications are turned on for your Favoritesüòç with a 10% threshold. Anytime one of the tokens from your Favoritesüòç changes the price by more than 10% in 30 minutes, you will receive a notification inside Alerts & Notifications section.

You can change the 10% threshold by going to My Alerts and looking for the edit icon(which looks like a pencil).&#x20;
