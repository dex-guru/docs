# Trending Tab



![Trending Tab is located inside the Market Selector ](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/r19mMZ75gfndmvvktsMfzBmYNaWSZdROnk9rIzBnn2kGJpg13QTL2Tr7Iu9E9EfXkEcQ29Y2D3NuXhXXwD90Q9udwAGQSmhIcMKQ9ZFwOhNvNT\_XXRRC-OpgFCm9cMawPsZ37Y8D)

**Which tokens get listed inside the Trending Tab?**

The formula below shows how we calculate the _m_ value for each day. The _m_ value is the metric we use for the [Market Screener](https://docs.dex.guru/features/market-activity/market-screener). To pick tokens for the Trending Tab, we compare the current Market Screener (_m_) metric to the largest _m_ value __ over the last 30 days. Below is the formula for the _m_ value over 24 hours.&#x20;

The value m represents the difference between buy volume and sell volume of Whale üê≥ traders (heavy Trader with $500k+ of a trading volume in the last 30 days) in the previous 24 hours. The m value is similar to the [Speculative Sentiment Index](https://www.fxcm.com/markets/insights/speculative-sentiment-index-ssi/). The ratio inside the formula determines if the m value is positive or negative. If m is positive, more tokens have been bought than sold by Whale üê≥ traders and vice versa. We multiply the ratio by the number of Whale üê≥ traders to filter tokens with a high probability of manipulation. For example, when one Whale trader buys most of the token‚Äôs supply to drive the price up. \


When we calculate the Trending Tab, we consider the maximum and the minimum _m_ values for the previous 30 days. We use the below k indicator similar to the [stochastic oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic\_oscillator) to determine what tokens we list in the Trending tab. The k indicator value can be between 0 and 100. When _k_ is bigger than 60, the token is considered for the Trending tab. The _k_ indicator shows how close the current _m_ value is to the maximum _m_ over the previous 30 days. We only list tokens with positive _m_ value, where Whale üê≥ buyers strongly dominate Whale üê≥ sellers.
