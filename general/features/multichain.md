# Multichain

At DexGuru, we believe in EVM-compatible chains. Currently, we support Ethereum assets ERC-20, Binance Smart Chain assets BEP-20, Polygon Network (previously Matic Network), Avalanche, Fantom, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Celo network assets. \


To trade tokens of a different network, connect a wallet that supports the specific network or change network settings in your wallet. For Metamask network selector looks like this:

![Metamask network selector](<../../.gitbook/assets/Multichain 01.png>)

To identify tokens from different networks, we use colored circles around the tokenâ€™s icon. In the example below, Binance Smart Chain is wrapped in the orange circle. For your convenience, web3 wallets that are connected, displayed in the same color as the circles around specific networks.&#x20;

Note: You can't trade assets from different networks for each other. For example,  you can't trade UNI(ERC20 token on Ethereum) for CAKE (BEP20 token on BSC). However, many Ethereum based tokens have pegged versions on BSC, for example, ETH-BSC on a screenshot above.
