* Token has had their balance (# number of Tokens) change in the last 7 days&#x20;
* Greater than >$10 in total market value

* **7 Day Change -** The change in the wallet's Token Balance during the last 7 days for this specific token
* **Average Acquisition Price\*** **-** The average acquisition price of the Token by the wallet
* **In/Out/At Money Status -** Displays whether the wallet is current in/out/at the money based on their Average Acquisition Price compared to the Token's Current Price.

{% hint style="info" %}
_**\*Note:** Transactions that involve a transfer of the Token from one wallet to another are also included in the Acquisition Price. For these transactions, the Token Price at the time of transfer will be taken to be included in the calculation of the Average Acquisition Price._
{% endhint %}

Additionally, by clicking on the Token Balances, you will be able to see how the user's Token Balance for that specific token has changed over time. This graph is also charted alongside the Token price.
