# Meta-aggregation

Meta-aggregation is a unique mechanism DexGuru uses to optimize trades and offer you the best rates. To start leveraging its power simply go to [Trading Tools](./).

### How does it work?

Supporting multiple decentralized exchange aggregators allows us to request a quote from each and provide you with a better option. We call it meta-aggregation.

Meta-aggregation is available for market orders on Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Arbitrum, Optimism, and CELO networks. We currently use 0x and 1inch protocols to provide this feature to you.

As a DexGuru user, you interact with multiple smart contracts depending on the router. You can find the list of them in the [wallets-security-and-more.md](../../../more-info/wallets-security-and-more.md "mention")section.



“**Router”** is an exchange aggregator we use to request a quote.\
“**Via”** lists decentralized markets that **Router** is going to use for your order.
