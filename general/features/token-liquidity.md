This section of the DexGuru interface shows available on-chain token liquidity and AMM’s pool activity. It shows when and how many tokens are deposited or removed from the liquidity pools for the given token. \


To specify the token liquidity pool you want to look at, pick it in the [Market Selector](https://docs.dex.guru/features/market-selector) are. \


Note: We measure liquidity $ value for a token, not for a trading pair. ****&#x20;
