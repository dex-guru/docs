When you're trading on DexGuru you're interacting with smart contracts deployed on public blockchains such as Ethereum or BSC. At the moment we use 0x protocol API for the most optimal orders routing and executing. In practice, it means that ERC20 token approvals are going directly to "0x: Exchange Proxy smart contract" at _**`0xdef1c0ded9bec7f1a1670819833240f027b25eff`**_ \(same address for Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, and Avalanche\).
