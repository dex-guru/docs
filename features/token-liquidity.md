# Token Liquidity



This section of the DexGuru interface shows available on-chain token liquidity and AMMâ€™s pool activity. It shows when and how many tokens are deposited or removed from the liquidity pools for the given token.   


To specify the token liquidity pool you want to look at, pick it in the [Market Selector](https://docs.dex.guru/features/market-selector) are.   


Note: We measure liquidity $ value for a token, not for a trading pair. ****
