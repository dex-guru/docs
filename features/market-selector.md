We use [Ethereum token list standard](https://tokenlists.org/) to check and verify the token smart contract address. At least 2 different token lists should have the token listed to get verified status at our UI. Keep in mind, verified status doesn't mean to be investment advice, a stamp of approval, or any kind of recommendation. It just a sign that a particular token smart contract address is reputable enough and being recognized in the industry with an appropriate ticker.
