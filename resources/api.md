# API

Please refer to [https://api.dev.dex.guru/docs](https://api.dev.dex.guru/docs) for information about our Public API that provides you with on-chain data.



Refer to [https://github.com/dex-guru/meta-aggregation-api](https://github.com/dex-guru/meta-aggregation-api) for Meta-aggregation API to trade tokens. It serves as a wrapper for multiple DEX aggregators(Routers) and finds the best price and route for token swap orders between quotes from supported routers.&#x20;
